Units
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.

Observation:
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

Variables

- "subjectID"
    30 subjects, with ID 1 to 30. they are 30 volunteers
- "activity"
    activity name for the testing signal

Activities
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain

following are the names of variables of activites. they are picked from 561 vectors, and applied average
